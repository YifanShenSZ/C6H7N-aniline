The data set will be read from: 
    data/sad-A1/, 
There are 50 data points in adiabatic representation
          0 data points in composite representation

maximum ground state energy = 0.00636254
maximum ||ground state energy gradient||_infinity = 0.0108162
so we suggest to set gradient / energy scaling to around 1.69998

Got regularization strength, enable regularization

The number of threads = 4
