The data set will be read from: 
    data/min-A2/, 
There are 50 data points in adiabatic representation
          0 data points in composite representation

maximum ground state energy = 0.227875
maximum ||ground state energy gradient||_infinity = 0.0114946
so we suggest to set gradient / energy scaling to around 0.0504424

Got regularization strength, enable regularization

The number of threads = 4
