The data set will be read from: 
    data/sad-B2/, 
There are 50 data points in adiabatic representation
          0 data points in composite representation

maximum ground state energy = 0.183069
maximum ||ground state energy gradient||_infinity = 0.0102595
so we suggest to set gradient / energy scaling to around 0.0560417

The number of threads = 4
