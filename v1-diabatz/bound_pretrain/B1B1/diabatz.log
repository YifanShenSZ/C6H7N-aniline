The data set will be read from: 
    ../data/min-B1/, 
There are 50 data points in adiabatic representation
          0 data points in composite representation

maximum ground state energy = 0.16254
maximum ||ground state energy gradient||_infinity = 0.0112719
so we suggest to set gradient / energy scaling to around 0.0693484

The number of threads = 4
