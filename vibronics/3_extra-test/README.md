# Extra test
After virtual test and active test, we should have obtained a converged spectrum. However, compared to the experiment, the intensity of high-energy region is overestimated, so we carry out extra test

## Possibility 1: bad high-energy level
Try to increase 3B1 phonon from 9 to 14, nothing changes

## Possibility 2: inappropriate Franck-Condon approximation
From min-B1 to min-A1, || transition dipole|| from A1 to B2 has halfened, but we need more coding to deal with geometrically-dependent dipole
