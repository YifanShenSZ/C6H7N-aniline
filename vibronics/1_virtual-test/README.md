Conclusion: no C-H stretching, add 1 phonon to 4 A2 + 1 B2 modes, truncate to single and double excitations

## Steps
Try raw B2 A2 phonons predicted from continuum model (0.75) and 1 phonon to 5 extra modes (0.75+5) for contour 0.75. 0.75+5 is necessary

Try truncating 0.75+5 to single and double excitations and removing C-H phonons (0.75DH). 0.75DH is almost the same to 0.75+5
