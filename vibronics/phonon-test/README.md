# Convergence test
Conclusion: no C-H stretching, add 1 phonon to 4 A" modes, truncate to double excitations

## Steps
Try continuum B2 A2 phonons (0.75) and 1 phonon to 4 extra modes (0.75#) for contour 0.75. 0.75# is necessary

Try truncating 0.75# to single and double excitations and removing C-H phonons (0.75DH). 0.75DH is almost the same to 0.75#
