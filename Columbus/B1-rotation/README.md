# NH2 rotation from min-B1
Start from min-B1, rotate NH2 until the rotational saddle point

Due to the G4 CNPI symmetry, only rotations within pi / 2 are unique, which is 2.221441469079183 = pi / sqrt(2) in internal coordinate 36. We rotate 22 steps, i.e. the step length is 0.10097461223087195

C2v-planar becomes C2, then C2v-perpendicular as the rotational saddle point

Each point has B1 state energy optimized with internal coordinate 36 fixed; 2.2 has more coordinates fixed to preserve C2v-perpendicular symmetry

## Issue
1.9 and 2.0 and 2.1 cannot be optimized since the B2 state crosses the B1 state

Starting from 0.7, a higher pi->pi* state mixes with the A2 state. Starting from 1.0, this mixture becomes intolerable. Discontinuity happens for the A2 state at 1.2, but B2 and A1 are much better, and B1 is perfectly continuous, so maybe the data is still usable
