# Angles of the NH2 group
Since the original internal coordinate definition is intended to work for both bound and dissociation regions, it is not optimal for the large-amplitude angle scan from the bound region

The original internal coordinate definition did not have H-N-H angle; it was described by C-N-H1 + C-N-H2. So, in order to add more data for H-N-H angle, here internal coordinate 13 is replaced with H-N-H

H-N-H is not independent from C-C-N-H1 - C-C-N-H2, so internal coordinate 20 is replaced with C out of NH2

Starting from min-B1, scan along internal coordinates:
* A1 H-N-H: 13
* B1 C out of NH2: 20

Starting from min-A1, scan along A1 H-N-H

step = 0.1, 10 steps each direction
