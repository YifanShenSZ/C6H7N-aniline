# The bound N-H vibration along fast dissociation path
<= 1.2 A are all good

At 1.3 A, a pi -> sigma* state may intrude the A2 state as sad-B1

\>= 1.3 A, a higher pi -> Rydberg state may intrude the B2 state as fast-1.6 and longer

## 1.1
[0.8, 1.2] are all normal

1.3 can use only 3 states: A1, B1, B2

## 1.2
[0.8, 1.2] are all normal

1.3 can use only 3 states: A1, B1, B2

## 1.3
[0.8, 1.1] can use only 3 states: A1, B1, B2

1.2 is all normal

1.3 can use only 3 states: A1, B1, B2

## 1.4
[0.8, 1.3] are all normal

1.4 can use only 2 states: A1, B1

## 1.5
[0.8, 1.3] have B2-A2 switched: A1, B1, A2, B2

[1.4, 1.5] can use only 2 states: A1, B1
