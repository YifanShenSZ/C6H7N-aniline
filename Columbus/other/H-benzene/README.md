# Benzene hydrogen distortion
Startinf from min-B1, scan along internal coordinates:
* A1 bending: 11, 12
* B1 out of plane: 15, 16, 17
* B2 bending: 28, 29, 30
* A2 out of plane: 34, 35

For A1 coordinates, scan positively and negatively; for others, scan positively

step = 0.1, 10 steps each direction (fewer if impossible to int2cart)

## B1 15
The perpendicular C-H bond stablizes the pi* orbitals, so an A1 pi->pi* (HOMO B1 pi to B1 pi*) state intrudes the A2 pi->Rydberg state from 6 to 9, so 0 to 5 can use 4 states while 6 to 9 can only use 3 states
