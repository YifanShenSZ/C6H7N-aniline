# Benzene distorsion
Startinf from min-B1, scan along internal coordinates:
* A1 bending: 9, 10
* B1 folding: 14, 15
* B2 bending: 27
* A2 torsion: 33

For A1 coordinates, step length = 0.05, 10 positive steps and 10 negative steps; for others, step length = 0.1, 10 positive steps

An A1 pi->pi* (HOMO B1 pi to B1 pi*) state may intrude, since benzene distorsion destablizes the pi system (smaller pi-pi* gap) so that pi->pi* states are favored

## A1-9
invasion is trivial crossing

state ordering:
*  0 to  9: A1, B1, B2, A2
* 10 to 13: A1, B1, B2, A2
* 14 to 19: A1, B1, B2, intruder, A2

5-state data is collected for [14, 19]

## A1-10
all normal

## B1-14
invasion is trivial crossing

state ordering:
* 0 to 5: A1, B1, B2, A2
* 6 to 9: A1, B1, B2, intruder, A2

5-state data is collected for [6, 9]

## B1-15
all normal

## B2-27
all normal

## A2-33
all normal
