# Benzene carbon skeleton distortion
Starting from min-B1, scan along internal coordinates:
* B1 torsion: 18
* A2 torsion: 33

step = 0.1, until impossible to int2cart

## B1 18
The benzene distortion destablize the pi orbitals, so so an A1 pi->pi* (HOMO B1 pi to B1 pi*) state intrudes the A2 pi->Rydberg state from 3 to 5, so 0 to 2 can use 4 states while 3 to 5 can only use 3 states
