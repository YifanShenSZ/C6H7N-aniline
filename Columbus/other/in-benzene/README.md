# In benzene plane
Startinf from min-B1, scan along internal coordinates:
* A1 bending: 11, 12
* B2 bending: 28, 29, 30

For A1 coordinates, scan positively and negatively; for others, scan positively

step = 0.1, scan until impossible to int2cart or converge mcscf

An A1 pi->pi* (HOMO B1 pi to B1 pi*) state may intrude, since in-benzene-plane displacements destablize the pi system (smaller pi-pi* gap) so that pi->pi* states are favored
