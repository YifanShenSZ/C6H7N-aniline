# H-N-N angle
The original internal coordinate definition did not have H-N-H angle; it was described by C-N-H1 + C-N-H2. So, in order to add more data for H-N-H angle, here internal coordinate 13 is replaced with H-N-H

H-N-H is not independent from C-C-N-H1 - C-C-N-H2, so internal coordinate 20 is replaced with C out of NH2
