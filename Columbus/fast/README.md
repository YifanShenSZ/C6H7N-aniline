# Fast dissociation path
This path corresponds to the fast dissociation peak observed in experiment, where the aniline molecule stays planar during stretching N-H bond

Most data points along this path have their B1 state energy minimized with N-H bond length constrained. The exceptions are the saddle point, the A1-B1 minimum energy crossing, and otherwise noticed.

## Issue
The points between 2 A and 3 A (2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8) are so hard to optimize, since the rasscf often converge to wrong local minimum, which cannot be avoided by Cs symmetry since the local minimum also has Cs symmetry
