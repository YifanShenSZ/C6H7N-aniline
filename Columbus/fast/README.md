# Fast dissociation path
This path corresponds to the fast dissociation peak observed in experiment, where the aniline molecule stays planar during stretching N-H bond

Most data points along this path have their B1 state energy minimized with N-H bond length constrained. The exceptions are the saddle point, the A1-B1 minimum energy crossing, and otherwise noticed.
