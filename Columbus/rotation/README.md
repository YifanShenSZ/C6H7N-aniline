# NH2 rotation
Since *diabatz* keeps getting trouble from imaginary NH2 rotation, we collect more data along this mode

Due to the G4 CNPI symmetry, only rotations within pi / 2 are unique, which is 2.221441469079183 = pi / sqrt(2) in internal coordinate 36. We rotate 22 steps, i.e. the step length is 0.10097461223087195

# min-B1
start such rotation from min-B1

C2v becomes C2, then C2v again as the rotational saddle point

# min-A1
start such rotation from min-A1

Since min-A1 also has a small N out of C3 plane angle, while the rotational saddle point should have Cs symmetry, we also move internal coordiante 19 so that after 22 steps it becomes 0

Cs (mirror plane = benzene bijection plane) becomes C1, then Cs (mirror plane = benzene plane) again as the rotational saddle point
