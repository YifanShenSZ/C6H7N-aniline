# Slow dissociation path
This path corresponds to the slow dissociation peak observed in experiment, where the stretched N-H bond becomes perpendicular to the benzene plane. This path corresponds to the "bijection plane" path in phenol, although the 2nd N-H bond breaks the rigorous mirror symmetry

This path is accessed by going along the h direction at mex-A1-B1, where the electrons fall to the A1 state

Most data points along this path have their A1 state energy minimized with N-H bond length constrained. The exceptions are noticed.

## Issue
The points starting from 1.6 A are so hard to optimize, since the rasscf often converge to wrong local minimum

1.6 is the most pain in the ass. The local minimum there is just inevitable

1.7 can be done with the out of benzene plane angle of the 2nd H constrained to 0, although the true minimum should have it slightly above 0. The remaining force is 0.008, so be it
