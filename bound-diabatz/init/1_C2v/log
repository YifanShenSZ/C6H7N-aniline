The data set will be read from: 
    min-B1/, sad-B2/, min-A2/, 
There are 150 data points in adiabatic representation
          0 data points in composite representation

maximum ground state energy = 0.0157841
maximum ||ground state energy gradient||_infinity = 0.0612082
so set gradient / energy scaling to 3.87783

The data set corresponds to 13488 least square equations
There are 1145 parameters to train

The number of threads = 4
Each thread owns 37 data points in adiabatic representation
                 0 data points in composite representation
The last thread owns 39 data points in adiabatic representation
                     0 data points in composite representation
Thread 0 starts with Jacobian row 0
Thread 1 starts with Jacobian row 2935
Thread 2 starts with Jacobian row 6056
Thread 3 starts with Jacobian row 9707

The initial residue = 4.75505

 acy goal
 Final residual =   2.575244200981924E-002
The final residue = 0.0257524
