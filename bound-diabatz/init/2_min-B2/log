The data set will be read from: 
    min-B1/, sad-B2/, min-A2/, min-B1_min-B2/, min-B2/, 
There are 212 data points in adiabatic representation
          0 data points in composite representation

maximum ground state energy = 0.0177058
maximum ||ground state energy gradient||_infinity = 0.0631569
so set gradient / energy scaling to 3.56702

The data set corresponds to 22282 least square equations
There are 1145 parameters to train

The number of threads = 4
Each thread owns 53 data points in adiabatic representation
                 0 data points in composite representation
The last thread owns 53 data points in adiabatic representation
                     0 data points in composite representation
Thread 0 starts with Jacobian row 0
Thread 1 starts with Jacobian row 4691
Thread 2 starts with Jacobian row 9382
Thread 3 starts with Jacobian row 14523

The initial residue = 0.570459

 acy goal
 Final residual =   6.368823811183770E-002
The final residue = 0.0636882
