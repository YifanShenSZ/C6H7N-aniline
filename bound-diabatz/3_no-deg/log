The data set will be read from: 
    min-B1/, sad-B2/, min-A2/, min-B1_min-B2/, min-B2/, min-A1/, 
There are 269 data points in adiabatic representation
          0 data points in composite representation

Got regularization strength, enable regularization

maximum ground state energy = 0.0254527
maximum ||ground state energy gradient||_infinity = 0.0795752
so set gradient / energy scaling to 3.1264

The data set corresponds to 30501 least square equations
There are 1171 parameters to train

The number of threads = 4
Each thread owns 67 data points in adiabatic representation
                 0 data points in composite representation
The last thread owns 68 data points in adiabatic representation
                     0 data points in composite representation
Thread 0 starts with Jacobian row 0
Thread 1 starts with Jacobian row 5601
Thread 2 starts with Jacobian row 11552
Thread 3 starts with Jacobian row 19873

The initial residue = 0.231809
 Trust region warning: step length has converged, but residual has not met accur
 acy goal
 Final residual =   9.383513472005230E-002
The final residue = 0.0755455
