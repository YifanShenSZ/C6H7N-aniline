The data set will be read from: 
    min-B1/, sad-B2/, min-A2/, min-B1_min-B2/, min-B2/, mex-B1-B2/, 
    min-A1/, 
There are 292 data points in adiabatic representation
          34 data points in composite representation

maximum ground state energy = 0.0254527
maximum ||ground state energy gradient||_infinity = 0.0795752
so set gradient / energy scaling to 3.1264

The data set corresponds to 38780 least square equations
There are 1149 parameters to train

The number of threads = 4
Each thread owns 73 data points in adiabatic representation
                 8 data points in composite representation
The last thread owns 73 data points in adiabatic representation
                     10 data points in composite representation
Thread 0 starts with Jacobian row 0
Thread 1 starts with Jacobian row 6919
Thread 2 starts with Jacobian row 14908
Thread 3 starts with Jacobian row 26189

The initial residue = 0.47025

 Final residual =   0.463794810086995     
The final residue = 0.463795
