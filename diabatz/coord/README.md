# CNPI symmetry adapted and scaled internal coordinate
The C2v-planar point group symmetry adapted internal coordinates map to G8 CNPI group symmetry adapted internal coordinates by:
* A1 -> irred-1
* B1 -> 1 irred-6 + 6 irred-7
* B2 -> 2 of irred-2 + 10 of irred-3
* A2 -> 3 of irred-4 + 1 of irred-8

Others are redundant

## torsions
The potential energy surfaces along NH2 rotation have minima at 0 and pi, maxima at +-pi/2, period pi, so only `cos2theta`, `cos4theta`, ... are meaningful for Hd diagonals
