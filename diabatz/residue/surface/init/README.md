## step 1: randomly generate resnet initial guesses
mostly good, but imaginary frequency at min-A1

## step 2: increase critical data weight
double min-A1 and other critical data weight, then the imaginary frequency is gone

however, A2 is imperfect: energy still goes up after sad-A2

maybe because the pretraining is imperfect and the resnet is not enough to perfect it, since it is well regularized
