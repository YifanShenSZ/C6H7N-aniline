# Data set

## script
`5to4.sh`:
* some data sets contains 5 states because the 4th state is an intruder
* this script automatically removes the gradients involving the 4th state
* such data sets are `fast/1.6`, `slow/1.6`, `fast/1.7`, `slow/1.7`, `mex-A1-B1`

`4to3.sh`:
* some data sets has the 4th state mixed with a higher state
* this script automatically removes the gradients involving the 4th state
* such data sets are `sad-B1`, `linear_path/1.3-fast-slow`, `B1-rotation/0.7`, `B1-rotation/0.8`, `B1-rotation/0.9`, `B1-rotation/1.0`, `B1-rotation/1.1`, `B1-rotation/1.2`

`3to2.sh`:
* some data sets has the 3rd state mixed with a higher state
* this script automatically removes the gradients involving the 3rd state
* such data sets are `B1-rotation/1.9`, `B1-rotation/2.0`, `B1-rotation/2.1`

`keep_critic.py`:
* for a loop generated by colinp
* keep only the data at the critical geometry
* remove other loop data

`keep_loop.py`:
* for a loop generated by colinp
* remove the critical geometry
* keep other loop data
