# Data set
harmonic region:
* sad-A1
* min-B1
* sad-B2
* min-A2
* fast/1.1

need 4th-order C out of NH2 plane:
* linear_path/min-B1_min-B2
* min-B2
* min-A1

enough for now:
* slow/1.1
* linear_path/1.1-fast-slow
* A1-rotation/0.1
* A1-rotation/0.2
* A1-rotation/0.3
* A1-rotation/0.4
* A1-rotation/0.5
* A1-rotation/0.6
* B1-rotation/0.1
* B1-rotation/0.2
* B1-rotation/0.3
* B1-rotation/0.4
* B1-rotation/0.5
* B1-rotation/0.6

need 4th-order NH2 hydrogen coordinates:
* everything left

loops around `fast` and `slow` are stored in `fast-loop` and `slow-loop`. I am not sure when to use them yet

other data are not included for now because their electronic structures are flawed

## scripts
`5to4.sh`:
* some data sets contains 5 states because the 4th state is an intruder
* this script automatically removes the gradients involving the 4th state
* such data sets are `fast/1.6`, `slow/1.6`, `fast/1.7`, `slow/1.7`, `mex-A1-B1`

`4to3.sh`:
* some data sets has the 4th state mixed with a higher state
* this script automatically removes the gradients involving the 4th state
* such data sets are `B1-rotation/0.7`, `B1-rotation/0.8`, `B1-rotation/0.9`, `B1-rotation/1.0`, `B1-rotation/1.1`

`keep_critic.py`:
* for a loop generated by colinp
* keep only the data at the critical geometry
* remove other loop data

`keep_loop.py`:
* for a loop generated by colinp
* remove the critical geometry
* keep other loop data
