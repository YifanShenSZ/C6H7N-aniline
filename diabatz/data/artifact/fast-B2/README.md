Energy only

Starting from N-H length = 1.9 A, we cannot obtain the B2 state from C1 ab initio computation. From Cs ab initio computation, we can obtain it at 1.9 A and 2.0 A, but starting from 2.1 A we lose it again because an A1 pi->pi* state comes in

So we perform a Morse fit in order to extrapolate smooth B2 energies. We use the [0.7, 1.8] C1 result, 1.9 and 2.0 Cs result, then manually try to increase the 6.0 Cs A1 pi->pi* result until we have a smooth fit. From this fit, we obtain a smoothed [1.9, 6.0] result
