# Bound region input layer
The 2nd-order expansion is generated by:
1. `1_no-HN/` generates all G8 2nd-order terms without the 2 H connecting to N (HN)
2. `2_with-HN/` generates all G8 2nd-order terms, and the C2v 2nd-order terms who need a bridge, with HN. `H-N-H` (1,14) is considered independent replacing `H1-N-C + H2-N-C` (1,4); `C out of NH2` (6,1) is considered independent replacing `H1-N-C-C-C - H2-N-C-C-C` (3,13 and 7,7)
3. `3_HN-angles/` generates 4th-order HN-angle terms
4. manually generate 4th-order benzene angles and N out of benzene
5. manually generate 2nd-order C out of NH2 x 1st-order terms and 2nd-order NH2 rotation x 1st-order terms
6. manually generate 4th-order terms made up solely with redundant coordinates or the independent coordinates relating to the redundancy
7. `redundant_*/` generates the 4th-order cross terms between redundant coordinates and their corresponding independencies
8. `trim/` performs a data statistics then removes some of redundant terms because of `max(S) < 1e-3`
