Analyze loop integral around mex-B1-B2 and mex-B2-A2

This loop starts and ends at planarized mex-B1-B2. The loop consists of 3 parts:
* the loop around mex-B1-B2
* the loop around mex-B2-A2
* connection between these 2 loops

The connection is along N-H direction, of course

Each single conical intersection loop is a rectangle in the 2-dimensional branching plane

For mex-B1-B2, the branching plane is spanned by:
* the direction from planarized mex-B1-B2 to mex-B1-B2, which is partially `g` of mex-B1-B2
* â–½H12 at the planarized mex-B1-B2, which is partially `h` of mex-B1-B2

For mex-B2-A2, the branching plane is spanned by:
* N-H, which is partially `g` of mex-B2-A2
* the direction from planarized mex-B1-B2 to mex-B1-B2, which is partially `h` of mex-B2-A2
