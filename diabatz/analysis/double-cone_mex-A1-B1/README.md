# g-h plane double cone analysis based on diabatz
Analyze g-h plane double cone at mex-A1-B1

Although we love g-h plane, chemisists wants something more chemistry. Since g is dominated by N-H bond length and h is domiated by C-out-of-NH2 angle, we also output that length and that angle on mesh grids for plotting
