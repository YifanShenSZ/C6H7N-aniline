# g-h plane double cone analysis based on diabatz
Analyze g-h plane double cone at mex-B1-B2

A little modification is that we would like to show the symmetry-related dual conical intersections, so instead of `g` vector we use the internal coordinate direction where mex-B1-B2 deviates from C2v

Although we love g-h plane, chemisists wants something more chemistry. Since g is dominated by C-out-of-NH2 angle and h is domiated by benzene torsion, we also output those angles on mesh grids for plotting
