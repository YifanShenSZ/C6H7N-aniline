# 2nd-order expansion for bound region
This input layer is generated by:
1. `G8/` generates all G8 2nd-order terms, and the C2v 2nd-order terms who need a bridge
2. manually generate 2nd-order terms made up solely with redundant coordinates
3. `redundant_*/` generates the 2nd-order cross terms between (1,14) (6,1) and their corresponding independencies
