# Polynomial for input layer
We are using G8 CNPI group symmetry adapted polynomial, but it is the C2v point group that determines which terms can contribute locally. In another word, for a same polynomial order, there are more necessary terms than G8 allows. We have to retrieve those terms by raising the G8 polynomial order

G8 symmetry adapted internal coordiantes map to C2v-planar by:
1. 13 A1 = 13 irred-1
2.  7 B1 =  7 irred-7
3. 12 B2 = 10 irred-3 + 2 irred-2
4.  4 A2 =  3 irred-4 + 1 irred-8

G8 symmetry adapted internal coordiantes map to C2v-perpendicular by:
1. 13 A1 = 13 irred-1
2.  8 B1 =  6 irred-7 + 2 irred-2
3. 11 B2 = 11 irred-3
4.  4 A2 =  3 irred-4 + 1 irred-5
