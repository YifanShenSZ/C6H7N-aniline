# 4th-order expansion for bound region
This input layer is an addition to `../bound-2nd/`. The additional terms are generated by:
1. `NH2-rotation/` generates 4th-order NH2 rotation terms
2. manually generate 2nd-order NH2 rotation x 1st-order G8 term
3. manually generate 4th-order terms made up solely with redundant coordinates
4. `redundant_*/` generates the 4th-order cross terms between (1,14) (6,1) and their corresponding independencies
5. `trim/` performs a data statistics then removes some of `3.` and `4.` terms because of `max(S) < 1e-5`
