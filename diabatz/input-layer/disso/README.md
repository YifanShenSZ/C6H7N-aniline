# 2nd scaling for dissociation
This input layer is an addition to `../bound-4th/`. The additional terms are generated by:
1. `no-HN/` and `with-HN/` separates terms with or without HN from `../bound-4th/` (4th-order redundancy are removed)
2. manually generate 4th-order Morse for `1.in`
3. manually generate 4th-order 1st-scaling bias for `1.in`
4. `scale2/` replaces the 1st-scaling terms from `with-HN/` with the corresponding 2nd-scaling terms
5. manually generate 4th-order 2nd-scaling bias for `1.in`
6. since `(2,6) x (2,6)` is 0 at bound and maxmium at C6H5N limit, add `(2,6) x (2,6)` x `no-NH/` terms , except for `irred-4 x irred-4` and `irred-4 x irred-7` and `irred-7 x irred-7` terms since no out-of-plane loop is collected at C6H5N limit
7. `trim/` performs a data statistics then removes some of `6.` terms because of `max(S) < 1e-5`
