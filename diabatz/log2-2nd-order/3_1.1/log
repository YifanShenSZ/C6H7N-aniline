The data set will be read from: 
    sad-A1/, min-B1/, sad-B2/, min-A2/, linear_path/min-B1_min-B2/, 
    min-B2/, min-A1/, fast/1.1/, slow/1.1/, 
There are 454 data points in adiabatic representation
          0 data points in composite representation

maximum ground state energy = 0.0197857
maximum ||ground state energy gradient||_infinity = 0.11107
so we suggest to set gradient / energy scaling to around 5.61364

According to user defined energy threshold and gradient threshold,
set gradient / energy scaling to 1.33333

The number of threads = 24

Optimizer is trust region

Each thread owns 18 data points in adiabatic representation
                 0 data points in composite representation
The last thread owns 40 data points in adiabatic representation
                     0 data points in composite representation
