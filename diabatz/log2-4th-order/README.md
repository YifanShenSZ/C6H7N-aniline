# Hyperprameter test
Morse fit on fast dissociation path gives:
1. A1 state is a Morse with alpha = 1.5
2. B1 state is a 4th-order Morse with alpha = 1.5

So we know the self scaling (the 2 N-H bonds) should have alpha = 1.5

But the alpha other scaling (the 2 H-N-C angles and the 2 H-N-C-C dihedral angles) remains unknown:
1. v1: all 1.5
2. v2: all 1.0
3. v3: all 0.5

# v1
imaginary NH2 rotation for min-B1 at 5_1.3; no such issue at 4_1.2

possibly because 1.5 is too large, cannot balance the fast-slow-1.3 and the min-B1_min-A1 energy drops
