The data set will be read from: 
    sad-A1/, min-B1/, sad-B2/, min-A2/, linear_path/min-B1_min-B2/, 
    min-B2/, min-A1/, fast/1.1/, slow/1.1/, linear_path/1.1-fast-slow/, fast/1.2/, 
    slow/1.2/, linear_path/1.2-fast-slow/, 
There are 609 data points in adiabatic representation
          0 data points in composite representation

maximum ground state energy = 0.0361101
maximum ||ground state energy gradient||_infinity = 0.125353
so we suggest to set gradient / energy scaling to around 3.47141

According to user defined energy threshold and gradient threshold,
set gradient / energy scaling to 1.33333

The number of threads = 32

Optimizer is trust region
